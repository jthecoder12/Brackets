# Brackets programming language

Brackets is a programming language that only uses brackets. A Brackets program is just Python code converted to ASCII binary where "(" is 0 and ")" is 1.

Generate Brackets:
Use the generate Python script to convert binary into Brackets. The binary must be Python code in ASCII for it to run properly.

Brackets shell:
Use the shell Python script to run Brackets code without using a file.

Brackets decoder:
Use the Brackets decoder Python script to convert Brackets into text.

Brackets compiler:
Use the Brackets compiler to take Python code and create Brackets code. (python compiler.py codetocompile.py output.brac).

Brackets runner:
Use the Brackets runner Python script to run Brackets files. Put the filepath after the command. (python runner.py code.brac).

Examples:
There are some examples in this repository. The .brac file extension is used for Brackets code.
